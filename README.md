In this work, we explored different methods for protein representation learning from microscopy data. We evaluated the extracted representations on four biological benchmarks - subcellular compartments, biological processes, pathways and protein complexes.

## About
Despite major developments in molecular representation learning, **extracting functional information from biological images** remains a non-trivial
computational task. In this work, we revisit deep learning models used for *classifying major subcellular localizations*, and evaluate
*representations extracted from their final layers*. We show that **simple convolutional networks trained on localization classification can learn protein representations that encapsulate diverse functional information**, and significantly outperform currently used autoencoder-based models. 

## Methods & Results
We compare three methods for molecular representation learning:
* **Deep Loc** - a supervised convolutional network trained to classify subcellular localizations from images;
* **Paired Cell Inpainting** - autoencoder-based method for protein representation learning;
* **CellProfiler** - a classic feature extractor for cellular data;
